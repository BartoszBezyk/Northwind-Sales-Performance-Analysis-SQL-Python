# Sales Performance and Business Insights Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance, customer behavior, employee efficiency, and product profitability using data from the Northwind dataset. The analysis was conducted using PostgreSQL for data manipulation and Python for data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Northwind dataset](https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql/tree/master). This dataset is a sample database often used for demonstrating database operations. It contains data related to a fictional company's sales, including customers, products, employees, and orders. The dataset provides a rich set of tables that simulate a real-world business scenario.

## Project Overview

The main goals of this project were to:

1. **Identify Top Customers:** We identified the most profitable customers, allowing the business to reward their contributions and focus on maintaining strong relationships with them.
   
2. **Analyze Employee Performance:** We evaluated the sales performance of employees, highlighting those who excelled in their roles for potential rewards and identifying areas where other employees may need additional support or training.

3. **Evaluate Product Profitability:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of product performance, determining which products generate the highest profits. This allows the business to prioritize inventory and marketing efforts to maximize profits.

4. **Assess Stock and Demand Levels:** By analyzing the stock levels in relation to demand, we provided recommendations for optimal reorder levels, particularly for high-demand products, ensuring that inventory levels are aligned with customer demand.

5. **Examine Sales Trends and Seasonality:** We analyzed sales trends and seasonality, providing insights into how sales fluctuate over time and identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) that drive business success.

## Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL:** Used for querying and manipulating the data.
- **Python:** Used for data analysis and visualization, with libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
